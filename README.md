# Employee Roster

## Built with
- [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Installation
Tested with nodejs 16.1.0

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run local server on http://localhost:3000
3. To run tests, run `yarn test` or `npm test`

## Assumptions
- Tested in latest chrome with support for desktop only
- All code formatting was done with Prettier with default settings
- If I was to spend more time on this I would:
    - Expand upon unit tests
    - Introduce buttons and tables as encaspulated atoms
    - Add support for smaller sceen sizes (responsive layout)
    - Add more functionality to the way Payslips are rendered, a useful feature would be to have a print to PDF option
